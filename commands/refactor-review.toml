description = "Analyze code quality and create a refactoring improvement plan"
prompt = """
Using the refactorer skill, prepare a code quality review report. Analyze refactoring opportunities in the codebase and create a comprehensive plan WITHOUT making any changes.

## Input Parsing
The user invoked: /refactor-review <args>

Valid scopes:
- **No argument**: Analyze the entire project
- **File/directory path**: Scope analysis to that specific path
- **"current changes"**: Analyze uncommitted changes (use `git status` and `git diff`)
- **"recent changes"**: Analyze recent commits (use `git log` and `git diff`)
- **"PR #123"**: Analyze a specific pull request (use `gh pr view` and `gh pr diff`)

## Your Task
1. First, understand the code structure and identify areas needing refactoring
2. Analyze code quality issues and improvement opportunities
3. Create a prioritized refactoring plan
4. Save your plan as a markdown file in the /reports directory

## Analysis Steps
1. **Code Quality Assessment**
   - Check for code duplication
   - Identify complex functions/methods
   - Find SOLID principle violations
   - Look for unclear naming
   - Spot long parameter lists
   - Detect deeply nested code

2. **Identify Refactoring Opportunities**
   - Extract method candidates
   - Duplicate code consolidation
   - Complex conditionals to simplify
   - Magic numbers to replace
   - Dead code to remove
   - Abstractions to introduce

3. **Risk and Impact Analysis**
   - Assess testing coverage
   - Identify high-risk refactorings
   - Estimate complexity of changes
   - Consider dependencies

## Output Format
Create a markdown file at `/reports/refactor-review-{scope}-{timestamp}.md` with:

```markdown
# Refactoring Review Plan
Generated: {timestamp}
Scope: {full_path_or_entire_project}

## Executive Summary
Brief overview of code quality state and key findings

## Code Quality Metrics
- Duplication: X%
- Complex functions: Y
- Average function length: Z lines
- Key issues identified: N

## Refactoring Opportunities
### High Priority (Quick Wins)
- Extract method: functionName in file.ext
- Remove duplication: between fileA and fileB
- Simplify conditional: in functionX

### Medium Priority (Structural Improvements)
- Introduce abstraction for X
- Consolidate similar classes Y and Z
- Break down large class A

### Low Priority (Nice-to-Have)
- Rename variables for clarity
- Remove commented code
- Reorganize file structure

## Risk Assessment
### Safe Refactorings (Low Risk)
- List of refactorings with good test coverage

### Moderate Risk
- Refactorings requiring careful testing

### High Risk
- Major structural changes

## Implementation Strategy
1. Start with safe, high-impact refactorings
2. Ensure tests pass after each change
3. Review with team for major changes

## Estimated Effort
- Total refactoring tasks: X
- Quick wins: Y hours
- Major refactorings: Z hours
```

Remember: DO NOT make any changes. Only analyze and report.

## CRITICAL: Report Generation

**YOU MUST CREATE THE REPORT FILE.** This is not optional.

1. Create the report file using the Write tool
2. Fill in ALL sections with real findings
3. Provide the full path to the user when done
