description = "Process technical team feedback on an implementation plan and create an updated version"
prompt = """
Using the development-manager skill, process technical team feedback on an existing implementation plan and create an updated version that incorporates their input while maintaining technical coherence.

## Context
This command helps development managers process feedback from technical team members (architects, senior engineers, DevOps, QA, security) and create a revised implementation plan.

## Input Parsing
The user invoked: /process-implementation-plan-feedback {{args}}
- Parse the plan_file_path parameter
- If no file path provided, list available plans and ask user to specify

## Your Task
Gather technical feedback, analyze it, and create an updated implementation plan.

### Step 1: Read and Understand the Original Plan
- Read the implementation plan
- Understand current architecture, phases, and technical decisions
- Note risk assessments and mitigation strategies
- Review resource allocations and timelines

### Step 2: Gather Technical Feedback
Ask for feedback:
1. **Structured feedback**: Team member name, role, section, nature of feedback
2. **Code review comments**: Architecture concerns, technology suggestions
3. **Multiple inputs**: Collect from different technical roles

### Step 3: Categorize and Analyze Feedback
- **Critical Technical Issues**: Security, architecture flaws, blockers
- **Performance & Scalability**: Optimization concerns
- **Alternative Approaches**: Different technical solutions
- **Resource & Timeline**: Estimation adjustments
- **Risk Identification**: New risks, mitigation improvements
- **Technical Debt**: Shortcut concerns
- **Testing & Quality**: QA concerns

### Step 4: Process and Integrate Feedback
For each item:
1. **Accept and Integrate**: Modify architecture, timelines, risks
2. **Defer to Later Phase**: Document in "Future Optimizations"
3. **Decline with Technical Justification**: Explain, suggest alternatives
4. **Flag for Architecture Review**: Deeper discussion needed

### Step 5: Resolve Technical Conflicts
When team members provide conflicting approaches:
- Document each approach with pros/cons
- Analyze based on architecture, performance, maintainability
- Recommend resolution with technical justification

### Step 6: Update Plan Sections
- Technical Architecture
- Development Phases
- Resource Allocation
- Risk Assessment
- Testing Strategy
- Implementation Tickets

### Step 7: Recalculate Timeline and Resources
- Recalculate critical path
- Adjust phase durations
- Update resource requirements
- Ensure buffers remain appropriate

## Output Format
Create two files:

### 1. Updated Implementation Plan
Save at `/plans/implementation-plan-{product-name}-v{version}-{timestamp}.md`

### 2. Technical Change Log
Save at `/plans/changelog-implementation-{product-name}-{timestamp}.md` with:
- Executive Summary of Changes
- Architecture & Design Changes
- Timeline & Resource Adjustments
- Risk Assessment Updates
- Testing Strategy Improvements
- Deferred Improvements
- Declined Suggestions
- Technical Conflict Resolutions
- Updated Metrics

## Important Notes
- Maintain technical accuracy and feasibility
- Preserve architectural principles unless explicitly changed
- Keep estimates realistic based on team capabilities
- Document all technical decisions for future reference
- Consider security and performance implications
