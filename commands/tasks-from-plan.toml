description = "Convert a review plan into GitHub issues for tracking"
prompt = """
Convert a plan file into GitHub issues for systematic implementation. Each task becomes a GitHub issue with appropriate labels and skill recommendations.

## Input Parsing
The user invoked: /tasks-from-plan <args>
- Path should point to a plan file (typically in /plans directory)
- If no path provided, list available plan files and ask user to specify

## Your Task
1. Read the specified plan file
2. Parse the plan to identify discrete tasks
3. Group tasks by priority/phase
4. Create GitHub issues for each actionable task
5. Create any required labels BEFORE creating issues
6. DO NOT implement any tasks - only create tracking issues

## Issue Creation Strategy

### For Each Task:
1. **Title**: Concise, actionable task description
2. **Body**: Include:
   - Task details from the plan
   - Priority level (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
   - Phase/timeline information
   - Recommended specialist skill for implementation
   - Success criteria if specified
   - Dependencies on other tasks
   - **Source Plan section with link to plan file**
3. **Labels**: Add appropriate labels:
   - Priority (priority-critical, priority-high, priority-medium, priority-low)
   - Type (security, performance, architecture, etc.)
   - Phase (phase-1, phase-2, etc.)

## Skill Mapping for Tasks

| Task Type | Recommended Skill |
|-----------|------------------|
| Security fixes | security-master |
| Performance optimization | performance-optimizer |
| Architecture changes | architect |
| Documentation | code-documentor |
| Testing improvements | test-automator |
| Refactoring | refactorer |
| Modernization | code-modernizer |
| Build/CI/CD | build-master |
| Configuration | configuration-manager |
| Debugging/fixes | debugger |
| Error handling | exception-handling-master |
| Logging | logging-master |
| Developer tooling | toolsmith |
| Internationalization | internationalization-specialist |
| Accessibility | accessibility-specialist |

## Issue Template
```markdown
## Task Overview
{task_description}

## Priority
{Critical/High/Medium/Low}

## Phase
{phase_number_and_name}

## Implementation Details
{detailed_requirements_from_plan}

## Success Criteria
- [ ] {criterion_1}
- [ ] {criterion_2}

## Dependencies
- {list_any_prerequisite_tasks}

## Recommended Skill
This task should be handled by {skill_name} for optimal implementation.

## Source Plan
Generated from: [{plan_file_name}]({path_to_plan_file})

## Notes
- Review type: {review_type}
```

## Local Issue File Format
When GitHub is not available, create `/issues/{number}.md` with YAML frontmatter:
```markdown
---
number: 1
title: Fix SQL injection vulnerability
labels:
  - priority-critical
  - security
priority: Critical
phase: Phase 1
skill: security-master
dependencies: []
status: open
source_plan: plans/security-review.md
---
[Issue body...]
```

## Execution Steps
1. Validate plan file exists and is valid
2. Parse all actionable items
3. Group by priority or phase
4. Check if GitHub is available (`gh auth status`)
5. **If GitHub**: Use `gh issue create` for each task
6. **If local**: Create `/issues/{number}.md` files
7. Provide summary report

## Important Notes
- DO NOT attempt to implement any tasks
- Focus only on creating well-structured tracking issues
- Ensure each issue is self-contained with enough context
- Add cross-references between related issues
