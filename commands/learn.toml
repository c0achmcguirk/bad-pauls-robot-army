description = "Create a personalized learning path for mastering the codebase or specific technologies"
prompt = """
Using the mentor skill, create a customized learning path based on the user's goals and current knowledge level, saving the output to the reports directory.

## Input Parsing
The user invoked: /learn {{args}}

Examples:
- `/learn this codebase` - Overall codebase familiarization
- `/learn React hooks` - Specific technology in the project
- `/learn how to add new features` - Process-oriented learning
- `/learn testing best practices` - Skill development
- `/learn` - Interactive goal setting

## Your Task

### 1. Learning Assessment
Determine:
- What the user wants to learn
- Their current skill level
- Available time commitment
- Preferred learning style
- Specific goals or projects

Ask clarifying questions if needed.

### 2. Codebase Analysis
Research:
- Identify key concepts in the codebase
- Find good example code for learning
- Locate existing documentation
- Discover learning prerequisites
- Map dependencies between concepts

### 3. Path Construction
Create a structured learning journey:
- Start with foundations
- Build complexity gradually
- Include practical exercises
- Provide checkpoints for understanding
- Suggest real tasks from the codebase

### 4. Save Output
Create a markdown file at `/reports/learning-path-{topic}-{timestamp}.md`

## Learning Path Format

```markdown
# Learning Path: [Topic]

## Your Current Level
[Assessment of starting point]

## Learning Objectives
By completing this path, you will:
- Understand [concept]
- Be able to [skill]
- Know how to [task]

## Prerequisites
- Things they already know
- Things to review
- Things to learn first

## Learning Journey

### Phase 1: Foundations
**Goal**: [What they'll achieve]

#### Day 1-2: [Topic]
- **Read**: [Specific files to examine]
- **Understand**: [Key concepts]
- **Exercise**: [Hands-on task]
- **Check**: Can you explain [concept]?

### Phase 2: Deep Dive
[Continue pattern...]

### Phase 3: Mastery
[Advanced topics and projects...]

## Hands-On Projects
- Starter Project: Modify an existing feature
- Intermediate: Build a new component
- Advanced: Implement a complete feature

## Resources
- In This Codebase: Examples, patterns, tests
- Documentation: Internal and external
- Code Tours: Step-by-step walks through code

## Knowledge Checks
After each phase, verify understanding

## Tips for Success
- Code alongside reading
- Break things to learn
- Track progress
- Apply immediately
```

## Important Principles

1. Meet them where they are - Don't assume prior knowledge
2. Make it achievable - Start small and build confidence
3. Connect to real code - Abstract examples don't stick
4. Provide milestones - Clear progress indicators motivate
5. Encourage exploration - Discovery deepens understanding

Remember: The best learning path is one that gets followed. Make it engaging, practical, and rewarding.
