prompt = """
Using the product-manager skill, process stakeholder feedback on an existing Product Requirements Document (PRD) and create an updated version that incorporates their input while maintaining document coherence and tracking changes.

## Context
This command helps product managers systematically process feedback from stakeholders (engineering, design, business, customers) and create a revised PRD that addresses concerns, incorporates suggestions, and documents decisions.

## Input Parsing
The user invoked: /process-prd-feedback {{args}}
- Parse the prd_file_path parameter
- If no file path provided, list available PRDs and ask user to specify

## Your Task
Gather stakeholder feedback, analyze it, and create an updated PRD version.

### Step 1: Read and Understand the Original PRD
- Read the PRD file
- Understand current scope, requirements, and constraints
- Note areas marked as "open questions"

### Step 2: Gather Stakeholder Feedback
Ask the user to provide feedback:
1. **Structured feedback**: Stakeholder name, section, nature of feedback, priority
2. **Unstructured feedback**: Raw comments, emails, meeting notes
3. **Multiple inputs**: Collect from different stakeholders, note conflicts

### Step 3: Categorize and Analyze Feedback
- **Critical Changes**: Must be addressed (blockers, compliance, feasibility)
- **Important Enhancements**: Should be incorporated
- **Minor Suggestions**: Nice to have
- **Clarifications**: Need more detail
- **Conflicts**: Contradictory feedback

### Step 4: Process and Integrate Feedback
For each item:
1. **Accept and Integrate**: Modify PRD sections, update acceptance criteria
2. **Defer to Future Phase**: Document in "Future Enhancements"
3. **Decline with Rationale**: Explain why, suggest alternatives
4. **Request Clarification**: Prepare specific questions

### Step 5: Resolve Conflicts
When stakeholders provide conflicting feedback:
- Document both perspectives
- Analyze trade-offs
- Recommend resolution based on product vision, user impact, feasibility

### Step 6: Update PRD Sections
- Executive Summary
- Requirements
- User Stories
- Success Metrics
- Timeline
- Risks
- Dependencies

## Output Format
Create two files:

### 1. Updated PRD
Save at `/prds/prd-{product-name}-v{version}-{timestamp}.md`

### 2. Change Log
Save at `/prds/changelog-{product-name}-{timestamp}.md` with:
- Executive Summary of Changes
- Accepted Changes (with rationale)
- Deferred Items
- Declined Feedback (with rationale)
- Conflict Resolutions
- Outstanding Questions
- Next Steps

## Important Notes
- Maintain document quality and readability
- Preserve original product vision unless explicitly changed
- Keep requirements specific and measurable
- Document all decisions for future reference
- Be diplomatic when documenting declined feedback
