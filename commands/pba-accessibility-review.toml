First, activate the 'pba-workspace-tools' skill to ensure you have the correct tool mappings for this environment.

Using the pba-accessibility-specialist skill, prepare an accessibility review report. You must analyze the codebase for WCAG compliance, identify accessibility barriers, and create a comprehensive a11y improvement plan WITHOUT making any changes.

## Tool Configuration

**IMPORTANT**: Consult the pba-workspace-tools skill for your organization's configured tools.
Use ONLY the tools listed in the Active Configuration section of pba-workspace-tools.
If a capability is not configured, inform the user and continue with available capabilities.

## Input Parsing
The user invoked: /pba-accessibility-review {{args}}

Valid scopes:
- **No argument**: Analyze the entire project
- **File/directory path**: Scope analysis to that specific path
- **"current changes"**: Analyze uncommitted changes (use source_control `status` and `diff_uncommitted` capabilities)
- **"recent changes"**: Analyze recent commits (use source_control `log` capability)
- **Change request reference**: Analyze a specific PR/CL (use change_requests `view` and `diff` capabilities)

### Scope Resolution
Consult pba-workspace-tools for source_control and change_requests capabilities:

1. If scope is "current changes":
   - Use the `status` capability to identify changed files
   - Use the `diff_uncommitted` capability to see uncommitted changes
   - Focus analysis on modified code only

2. If scope is "recent changes":
   - Use the `log` capability to see recent commits
   - Analyze changes from recent development

3. If scope matches the change_requests `reference_format`:
   - Extract the change request ID from the scope
   - Use change_requests `view` capability to get details
   - Use change_requests `diff` capability to get the changes
   - Focus on files changed in the change request

4. If scope is a path:
   - Verify the path exists
   - Scope analysis to that path

5. If no scope provided:
   - Analyze the entire project

## Your Task
1. First, identify the current accessibility implementation status
2. Find WCAG violations and accessibility barriers
3. Identify assistive technology compatibility issues
4. Create a prioritized accessibility improvement plan
5. Save your plan as a markdown file in the /reports directory

## Analysis Steps
1. **Current Accessibility Assessment**
   - WCAG compliance level
   - Semantic HTML usage
   - ARIA implementation
   - Keyboard navigation support
   - Screen reader compatibility

2. **Accessibility Violations**
   - Missing alt text
   - Poor color contrast
   - Inaccessible forms
   - Keyboard traps
   - Focus management issues

3. **Assistive Technology Support**
   - Screen reader testing results
   - Keyboard-only navigation
   - Voice control compatibility
   - Browser accessibility features

## Output Format
Create a markdown file at `/reports/pba-accessibility-review-{timestamp}.md` with:

```markdown
# Accessibility Review Plan
Generated: {timestamp}
Scope: {full_path_or_entire_project}

## CRITICAL: Report Generation

**YOU MUST CREATE THE REPORT FILE.** This is not optional.

### Final Steps (MANDATORY)

1. **Create the report file** using the Write tool at the specified path:
   - Path format: `/reports/{command-name}-{scope}-{timestamp}.md`
   - Use ISO timestamp format: `YYYY-MM-DD-HHmmss`
   - Example: `/reports/architecture-review-entire-project-2025-10-14-143022.md`

2. **Fill in ALL sections** of the report template
   - Do not leave placeholder text
   - Provide specific, actionable findings
   - Include file paths and line numbers where relevant

3. **Confirm completion** by telling the user:
   - "Report saved to: [full path]"
   - Brief summary of key findings
   - Next steps or how to use the report

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **DON'T**: Just summarize findings in the chat
❌ **DON'T**: Say "I'll create a report" without actually doing it
❌ **DON'T**: Leave sections incomplete or with placeholders
❌ **DON'T**: Forget to use the Write tool

✅ **DO**: Always use the Write tool to create the markdown file
✅ **DO**: Fill in every section with real findings
✅ **DO**: Provide the full path to the user when done
✅ **DO**: Include actionable recommendations

### Verification Checklist

Before responding to the user, verify:
- [ ] Report file created with Write tool
- [ ] All template sections filled in
- [ ] Specific findings with file references
- [ ] Actionable recommendations included
- [ ] Timestamp in filename
- [ ] Full path provided to user

**Remember**: The report is the primary deliverable. The chat summary is secondary.
