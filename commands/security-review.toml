prompt = """
Using the security-master skill, prepare a security review report. Analyze security vulnerabilities and risks in the codebase and create a comprehensive plan WITHOUT making any changes.

## Input Parsing
The user invoked: /security-review <args>

Valid scopes:
- **No argument**: Analyze the entire project
- **File/directory path**: Scope analysis to that specific path
- **"current changes"**: Analyze uncommitted changes (use `git status` and `git diff`)
- **"recent changes"**: Analyze recent commits (use `git log` and `git diff`)
- **"PR #123"**: Analyze a specific pull request (use `gh pr view` and `gh pr diff`)

## Your Task
1. First, understand the codebase and identify potential security issues
2. Analyze vulnerabilities and security risks
3. Create a prioritized security improvement plan
4. Save your plan as a markdown file in the /reports directory

## Analysis Steps
1. **Security Vulnerability Scan**
   - Check for hardcoded secrets/credentials
   - Identify SQL injection risks
   - Find XSS vulnerabilities
   - Look for insecure dependencies
   - Detect authentication/authorization issues
   - Check for sensitive data exposure

2. **Security Best Practices Review**
   - Input validation practices
   - Error handling and logging
   - Encryption usage
   - Access control implementation
   - Session management
   - API security

3. **Compliance and Standards**
   - OWASP Top 10 coverage
   - Industry-specific requirements
   - Data protection compliance

## Output Format
Create a markdown file at `/reports/security-review-{scope}-{timestamp}.md` with:

```markdown
# Security Review Plan
Generated: {timestamp}
Scope: {full_path_or_entire_project}

## Executive Summary
Brief overview of security posture and critical findings

## Security Findings
### Critical Vulnerabilities
- Issue: Description and location
- Issue: Description and location

### High Priority Issues
- Vulnerability type: Details
- Security gap: Details

### Medium Priority Issues
- Best practice violation: Details
- Improvement opportunity: Details

### Low Priority Issues
- Minor issue: Details

## Vulnerability Details
For each critical/high issue:
- Description
- Potential impact
- Affected files/components
- Recommended fix

## Security Improvement Plan
### Immediate Actions (Critical)
1. Fix critical vulnerability X
2. Patch security hole Y

### Short-term
1. Implement input validation
2. Add authentication checks

### Long-term Improvements
1. Enhance security architecture
2. Implement security monitoring

## Compliance Status
- OWASP Top 10: X/10 covered
- Key gaps: List

## Recommendations
- Security tools to implement
- Training needs
- Process improvements

## Risk Assessment
- Current risk level: Critical/High/Medium/Low
- Post-mitigation risk level: Target
```

Remember: DO NOT make any changes. Only analyze and report.

## CRITICAL: Report Generation

**YOU MUST CREATE THE REPORT FILE.** This is not optional.

1. Create the report file using the Write tool
2. Fill in ALL sections with real findings
3. Provide the full path to the user when done
