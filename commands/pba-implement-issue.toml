First, activate the 'pba-workspace-tools' skill to ensure you have the correct tool mappings for this environment.

Automatically implement an issue by fetching it, solving it with the appropriate specialist skill, and creating a change request with the solution.

## Tool Configuration

**IMPORTANT**: Consult the pba-workspace-tools skill for your organization's configured tools.
Use ONLY the tools listed in the Active Configuration section of pba-workspace-tools.
If a capability is not configured, inform the user and continue with available capabilities.

## Usage
/pba-implement-issue {{args}}

## Examples
- `/pba-implement-issue 5` - Implement issue #5 (format depends on pba-workspace-tools config)
- `/pba-implement-issue issues/5.md` - Implement local issue file

The issue reference format is defined in pba-workspace-tools (`issue_tracking.reference_format`).
Examples: `#5` (GitHub), `b/5` (Internal), `PROJECT-5` (Jira)

## Workflow

### 1. Issue Retrieval
Consult pba-workspace-tools for issue_tracking capabilities:
- Use the configured `availability_check` to verify access (if defined)
- Use the configured `fetch_issue` tool with the issue ID
- **If issue_tracking not configured**: Read from `/issues/{number}.md`
- Parse for requirements, success criteria, recommended skill

### 2. Branch/Changelist Creation
Consult pba-workspace-tools for source_control capabilities:
- Create a branch or changelist for this work
- Naming convention: `issue-{number}-{slug}` (adapt to your VCS)
- Ensure working copy is up to date with main/trunk

### 3. Skill Selection
Look for skill recommendations in the issue body:
- Pattern: `@skill-{name}` or skill specified in frontmatter
- Fall back to analyzing issue labels and content

**Skill Mapping:**
| Issue Labels/Keywords | Selected Skill |
|----------------------|----------------|
| security | pba-security-master |
| performance | pba-performance-optimizer |
| architecture | pba-architect |
| documentation | pba-code-documentor |
| test, testing | pba-test-automator |
| refactor | pba-refactorer |
| modernize, upgrade | pba-code-modernizer |
| build, ci/cd | pba-build-master |
| config | pba-configuration-manager |
| bug, fix | pba-debugger |
| error, exception | pba-exception-handling-master |
| logging | pba-logging-master |
| tooling | pba-toolsmith |
| i18n | pba-internationalization-specialist |
| a11y, accessibility | pba-accessibility-specialist |

### 4. Implementation
- Invoke the selected skill with issue context
- Skill performs implementation autonomously

### 5. Validation
Before creating change request, validate:
- All changes are syntactically correct
- Project builds successfully
- All tests pass
- Linting passes
- No merge conflicts

### 6. Commit and Push
Consult pba-workspace-tools for source_control capabilities:
- Stage all changes using the configured tools
- Create descriptive commit message referencing issue (use `issue_tracking.reference_format`)
- Push/upload changes to remote

### 7. Completion
Consult pba-workspace-tools for change_requests capabilities:
- Use the configured `create` tool to create a change request/PR
- Title format: "Fix {issue_reference}: {issue_title}"
- Body MUST include reference to source issue
- Link the change request to the issue if your tools support it

**If change_requests not configured:**
- Update `/issues/{number}.md` frontmatter status
- Add completion timestamp
- Note that manual change request creation is needed

## Local Issue File Format
